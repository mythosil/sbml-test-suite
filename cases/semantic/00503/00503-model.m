The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species called 
S1, S2 and S3 and three parameters called k1, k2 and p1.  Species S1 is labeled 
as an SBML boundary species.   The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * C$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * C$  |]

  The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | S1 | $p1 * 2$  |]

Note: SBML's InitialAssignment construct override any declared initial
values.  In this model, the initial value for the species S1 has not been
explicitly declared and must be calculated using the InitialAssignment.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width 30em,margin-left 5em}| |*Value*        |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1        |$undeclared$     |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2        |$2.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3        |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1       |$0.75$           |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2       |$0.25$           |second^-1^                |
|Value of parameter p1       |$1.25 \x 10^-5$ |mole                |
|Volume of compartment C     |$1$              |litre                  |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) they must be treated as concentrations where they appear in
expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
